# UchuujinPatcher

Still a major work-in-progress.

A full remake and successor to [UchuujinPatchScripts](https://github.com/colebob9/UchuujinPatchScripts). UchuujinPatchScripts was always meant as a messy and easy way to just get the game patched together. This project aims to do the same process, but to do it fast, with a better structure, various improvements, and cross-platform (mainly for building patches on a server). Once this project reaches feature parity, the original repo will be archived.

# UchuujinPatcher

Scripts to easily automate the process for patching in the English translation and building a patch file as part of the Nichijou: Uchuujin [English Translation Project](https://github.com/UchuujinTranslate/uchuujin).

If you want to want to help with the development of this English patch, head over to our Discord! https://discord.gg/3pE8xdn


**These scripts are only for developers or translators that want to see the English patch in its most current state. If you are a play tester, there will be a much easier tool in the future for applying patch files to your game iso. (As of writing, no patches are available.)**

A major work-in-progress. PRs are welcome!


A full remake and successor to [UchuujinPatchScripts](https://github.com/colebob9/UchuujinPatchScripts). UchuujinPatchScripts was always meant as a messy and easy way to just get the game patched together. This project aims to do the same process, but to do it fast, with a better structure, various improvements, and cross-platform (mainly for building patches on a server). Once this project reaches feature parity, the original repo will be archived.

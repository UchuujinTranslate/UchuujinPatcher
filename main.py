# Use this file to structure the project and
# be the main way to order the scripts

# Order:
# config - Check if exists, if not, go into creation process
# setup

# Setup process, could run together
# mp1 - clone_repo
# mp1 - decompress_iso

# The rest must be in order roughly
# cpk_dump
# mp2 - patch_eboot
# mp2 - patch_sc
# cpk_pack
# replace_iso
# create_binary_patch
# distrib
